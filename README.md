## Project Structure

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to launch the chatbot.

## Backend Integration

- The chatbot attempts to connect to a backend server at `http://localhost:5000/chat`.
- If the backend is unavailable, it falls back to predefined responses.

## Customization

- Modify `style.css` to change the appearance of the chatbot.
- Update `script.js` to add or edit fallback responses.
